            <h3>Sharp Bounding Null Effects in Causal Experiments with Ordinal Outcomes</h3>
            <p>Proved sharp bounds on the probability of a null effect in causal experiments with ordinal outcomes before and after incorporating prior information on treatment efficacy. Manuscript in preparation.</p>

            <h3>Bot or Not? Uncovering Social Identity Biases in the
Perceived Humanity of Online Profiles</h3>
            <p>Designed a conjoint experiment to study the impact of social media profile identity expressions (race, gender, partisanship, etc.,) on the likelihood of the profile being flagged as a bot and whether social media users rate users from a different demographic subgroup as bots more often than they do users from their own demographic subgroup. Manuscript in preparation.</p>

            <h3>Spatial Divide and Conquer for Bayesian High-Dimensional Binary Outcome Models</h3>
            <p>Scaled up Bayesian hierarchical model-fitting for spatially correlated data with high-dimensional binary outcomes by creating a computationally efficient divide and conquer method. Applied method toanalyzing bird species presence/absence data. Manuscript in preparation.</p>
